# Text Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project presents a supervised machine learning approach for binary sentiment classification of short text reviews. The objective is to automatically classify textual data into two categories: Positive and Negative.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of manually created short text reviews labeled as Positive or Negative.  
It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of text classification.

Example samples:

- "I love this product" → Positive  
- "This is terrible" → Negative  
- "Amazing experience" → Positive  
- "Worst experience ever" → Negative

## Methodology

The following steps were implemented:

1. Data loading using Pandas  
2. Text vectorization using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF  
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression and/or Naive Bayes  
5. Model evaluation using Accuracy Score  
6. Sentiment prediction for new text inputs
